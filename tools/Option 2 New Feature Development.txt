Option 2: New Feature Development
Pick from the roadmap:

Bill Payment Reminders
Spending Trend Analysis (historical data)
Budget Forecasting
Net Worth Tracking

Option 3: Bug Fixes or Refinements
If you've noticed any issues while testing.
What's the priority?



Quick wins (1-2 hours):

Emergency Fund Dashboard Widget - Add a progress card to Dashboard showing target vs current emergency fund
Bill Payment Reminders - Alert banner when items are due within 3 days (already have the logic)

Medium complexity (3-5 hours):

OCR Scanner Enhancement - You have StatementScanner.jsx. Add actual OCR processing (Tesseract.js?) or improve the parsing logic
Debt Payoff Strategies - Add avalanche/snowball comparison to Calculator tab with visualizations

Complex (full day+):

Spending Trend Analysis - Requires adding historical data storage, time-series tracking, and trend charts
Budget Forecasting - Predictive model based on past spending patterns
Net Worth Tracking - New module for assets vs liabilities over time
