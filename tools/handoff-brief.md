## DAVE'S WORKING RULES - READ FIRST

1. **Full paths always** - Never use relative paths or shortcuts in code, commands, or instructions
2. **PowerShell = full paths** - All scripts must use complete directory paths
3. **Peer communication** - Refer to Dave as "Dave", work together as engineers
4. **Direct, no flattery** - Skip phrases like "great question", "excellent", etc.
5. **Ask, don't assume** - If you need a file not listed below, ask Dave to upload it

---

## CRITICAL: FILES REQUIRED FOR HANDOFF

**Before working on ANY task, you MUST review ALL 28 project files.**

### Instructions for Next AI:

Tell Dave: **"Run the PowerShell script to show me all 28 files, then paste the output."**

Dave will run:
```powershell
cd "C:\Users\david\Local Sites\main-dashboard\app\public\budget-dashboard-fs\ui"
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "tools\show-all-project-files.ps1"
After Dave pastes the output, verify you received all 28 files by counting them and confirming:
"Received all 28 files. Ready to proceed with your task."
DO NOT:

Proceed without reading all 28 files
Assume file contents from descriptions
Make changes based on incomplete information
Say "I can work with what I have" - you need ALL files

DATA MODEL
State Structure
javascript{
  buckets: {
    income: [],
    housing: [],
    transportation: [],
    food: [],
    personal: [],
    homeOffice: [],
    banking: [],
    subscriptions: [],
    emergencyFund: [],  // Auto-tracked for widget
    misc: []
  },
  archived: [],
  meta: {
    categoryNames: {},      // Custom display names
    categoryOrder: [],      // Drag-drop order
    emergencyFund: {
      targetMonths: 6,
      currentAmount: 0      // Auto-calculated from bucket
    }
  }
}
Budget Item
javascript{
  id: "housing-1696348800000",
  category: "Rent/Mortgage",
  estBudget: 1500.00,
  actualCost: 1500.00,
  dueDate: "2025-10-15",
  status: "pending" | "paid",
  previousState: { /* undo data for mark paid */ }
}
Emergency Fund Deposit
javascript{
  id: "emergencyFund-1696348800000",
  category: "October Deposit",
  estBudget: 500,
  actualCost: 500,  // Summed for widget
  dueDate: "2025-10-03",
  status: "paid"
}
Archived Item
javascript{
  id: "hom-4",
  category: "Google AI Pro",
  estBudget: 19.99,
  actualCost: 0,
  dueDate: "2025-09-20",
  status: "pending",
  originalBucket: "homeOffice",
  archivedAt: "2025-09-29T13:33:59.349Z"
}

CRITICAL IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
1. State Management (state.js)

Uses useSyncExternalStore for React 18 compatibility
Stable empty sentinels (EMPTY_ARRAY, EMPTY_OBJECT) prevent infinite loops
useBudgetState(selector) hook with selector support
computeTotals() exported for legacy imports
normalizeState() auto-adds missing buckets
Triple-save: file → localStorage → WordPress DB

2. Triple-Save Implementation
javascript// Primary: File save via save.php
fetch("/budget-dashboard-fs/save.php", {
  method: "POST",
  body: JSON.stringify(state)
})

// Backup: WordPress DB
fetch("/wp-json/budget/v1/state", {
  method: "POST",
  body: JSON.stringify({ state: state })
})

// Instant: localStorage
localStorage.setItem(STATE_STORAGE_KEY, JSON.stringify(state))
3. Category Order Fix (DashboardTab.jsx line 40)
javascriptconst categoryOrder =
  (state?.meta?.categoryOrder && state.meta.categoryOrder.length > 0)
    ? state.meta.categoryOrder
    : Object.keys(state?.buckets || {});
Problem: Empty meta.categoryOrder array broke Complete Budget List
Solution: Fallback to Object.keys(buckets) if categoryOrder empty
4. Emergency Fund Bucket (state.js defaultState)
javascriptbuckets: {
  emergencyFund: [],  // Must exist in default state
  // ... others
},
meta: {
  emergencyFund: {
    targetMonths: 6,
    currentAmount: 0  // Auto-calculated, don't manually set
  }
}
5. Protected Buckets (EditorTab.jsx)
javascriptconst PROTECTED_BUCKETS = new Set([
  'income','housing','transportation','food','personal',
  'homeOffice','banking','subscriptions','emergencyFund','misc'
]);
These buckets cannot be deleted, only renamed.
6. Row Color Logic (EditorTab.jsx getRowBackgroundColor)

Green (bg-green-100): status === 'paid'
Red (bg-red-100): overdue (diffDays < 0)
Yellow (bg-yellow-100): due soon (diffDays ≤ 5)
White (bg-white): pending (diffDays > 5)

7. Smart Payment Date Advancement

Income: +7 days (weekly), creates new entry for next Friday
Subscriptions: +1 year
All others: +1 month
Stores previousState for undo

8. Auto-Populate Actual Cost
javascriptconst finalValue = actualValue === 0 && item.estBudget > 0 
  ? item.estBudget 
  : actualValue;
If user leaves actualCost at 0 and blurs field, it copies estBudget.
9. Friday Income Generation (EditorTab.jsx)

Runs on mount if income bucket has < 4 entries for current month
Finds all Fridays in current month
Creates "CSC - Week 1-4" entries at $200 each
Sets dueDate to each Friday

10. Vite Proxy Configuration (vite.config.js)
javascriptproxy: {
  '/wp-json': {
    target: 'http://main-dashboard.local',
    changeOrigin: true,
    secure: false,
  },
  '/budget-dashboard-fs/save.php': {
    target: 'http://main-dashboard.local',
    changeOrigin: true,
    secure: false,
  }
}
11. Financial Health Score Calculation

5 weighted factors:

Income/Expense Ratio: 30% weight
Savings Rate: 25% weight
Debt-to-Income Ratio: 20% weight
Category Balance: 15% weight
Budget Adherence: 10% weight


Score ranges:

80-100: Healthy (green)
60-79: Coping (yellow)
0-59: Vulnerable (red)


Null-safe throughout, handles missing/malformed data

12. Statement Parser

Supports both table format (tabs/multiple spaces) and single-line format
Extracts: date (M/D format), merchant name, amount, transaction type
Auto-categorizes based on merchant keywords
Handles deposits, purchases, fees, refunds, returns
Converts parsed transactions to budget items ready for import

13. Styling Approach

All Tailwind utility classes - No separate CSS files needed
Inline JSX classes - Styles co-located with components
No CSS modules - Everything in className attributes
Consistent patterns:

Rounded corners: rounded-lg
Card shadows: shadow-lg
Borders: border border-gray-200
Card padding: p-4 or p-6
Flex/grid gaps: gap-4


Color scheme:

Primary: Blue (500/600)
Success: Green (500/600)
Warning: Yellow (500/600)
Danger: Red (500/600)
Info: Purple (500/600)
Neutral: Gray/Slate




KNOWN ISSUES & QUIRKS
1. Monthly Expense Inflation in Emergency Fund Widget
Issue: Widget assumes estBudget = monthly cost. Annual expenses inflate target.
Workaround: User sets estBudget to monthly equivalent (e.g., $1200/year → enter $100)
2. New Install Visibility
Issue: Emergency Fund bucket won't appear until state initializes
Mitigation: normalizeState() auto-adds missing buckets on save
3. Calculator Isolation
Note: Calculators display projections but don't modify budget state
Reason: This is intentional - calculators are for planning only
4. SpendingTrendsChart Simulation
Note: 6-month trend data is simulated based on current budget
Future Enhancement: Track actual monthly history for real trends
5. React 18 Strict Mode
Solution: LoadingGate uses global init promise lock to avoid duplicate initialization
Implementation: window.__BUDGET_INIT_PROMISE__ prevents double-fetch in dev mode

HANDOFF TO NEXT CHAT
Dave, copy this entire brief and say:
"Continue budget dashboard. Status: All core features complete and production ready. Latest commit: f5f1621 (EditorTab Tier 1 improvements). Handoff brief below. Ready for next task."
Working rules reminder:

Full paths always
PowerShell uses full paths
Treat as peer (Dave)
No flattery
Ask for files, don't assume

After uploading this brief:
Next AI will request: "Run the PowerShell script to show me all 28 files."
Then Dave runs:
powershellcd "C:\Users\david\Local Sites\main-dashboard\app\public\budget-dashboard-fs\ui"
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "tools\show-all-project-files.ps1"
All files reviewed → Next AI is fully briefed → Ready to work.

PROJECT NOTES

save.php location: Intentionally at parent level (budget-dashboard-fs/) for proper backend/frontend separation. Do not move into ui/ directory.
tailwind.config.js: Does not exist - project uses Tailwind 4's @tailwindcss/vite plugin which doesn't require a config file.
All utility files present: No missing dependencies. All 28 files accounted for and functional.
Statement Scanner: Fully functional with OCR support via pdfjs-dist and camera capture.
Financial Health: Complete with automated scoring, recommendations, and trend tracking.
Triple-save system: JSON file + localStorage + WordPress DB (all working, see console logs).
Styling approach: All Tailwind utility classes in JSX. No separate CSS files needed. Co-located styles for maintainability.
Data current as of: October 6, 2025, 8:59 AM (see budget-data.json timestamp)
